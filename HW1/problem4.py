#1 Since it is a binary classifying task, there are two options, thus a random guess would be correct 50% of the time. For 100 trials, 50 of them are expected to be correct.
#2 Puzzle of type 1 is picking which BONGO block contains the shape, regardless of size and orientation, in the test image; the other BONGO block will be empty. Type 2 puzzle has shapes in both BONGO blocks. However, one will contain the shape, with the exact size and orientation, that is depicted in the test image. Type 3 puzzle is similar to type 2, but now the BONGO block that contains the shape present in the test image is different in size and orientation. Type 4 is similar to type 3, but instead of the shapes having at most four sides - a square - the shapes can now have up to the six sides of a hexagon.
